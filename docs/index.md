## Q1： How many sars-cov-2 papers?

``` r
# Downloading the website
website <- xml2::read_html("https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=sars-cov-2")

# Finding the counts
counts <- xml2::xml_find_first(website, "/html/body/main/div[9]/div[2]/div[2]/div[1]/div[1]")

# Turning it into text
counts <- as.character(counts)

# Extracting the data using regex
stringr::str_extract(counts, "[0-9,]+")
```

    ## [1] "120,890"

## Q2： Academic publications on COVID19 and Hawaii

``` r
library(httr)
query_ids <- GET(
  url   = "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/esearch.fcgi",
  query = list(
    db = "pubmed",
    term = "covid19 hawaii",
    retmax = 1000
    )
)

# Extracting the content of the response of GET
ids <- httr::content(query_ids)
```

## Q3：Get details about the articles

``` r
# Turn the result into a character vector
ids <- as.character(ids)

# Find all the ids 
ids <- stringr::str_extract_all(ids, "<Id>[[:digit:]]+</Id>")[[1]]

# Remove all the leading and trailing <Id> </Id>. Make use of "|"
ids <- stringr::str_remove_all(ids, "<Id>|</Id>")

publications <- GET(
  url   = "https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/",
  path  = "entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi",
  query = list(
    db = "pubmed",
    id = I(paste(ids, collapse=",")),
    retmax = 1000,
    rettype = "abstract"
    )
)

# Turning the output into character vector
publications <- httr::content(publications)
publications_txt <- as.character(publications)
```

## Q4 Distribution of universities, schools, and departments

``` r
institution <- str_extract_all(
  tolower(publications_txt),
  "university\\sof\\s+(southern|the|new|northern)?\\s*[[:alpha:]-]+|[[:alpha:]-]+\\s+insititute\\sof\\s+[[:alpha:]-]+"
  )

## Q5： Form a database

``` r
pub_char_list <- xml2::xml_children(publications)
pub_char_list <- sapply(pub_char_list, as.character)
```

Geitting the abstracts

``` r
abstracts <- str_extract(pub_char_list, "<Abstract>[[:print:][:space:]]+</Abstract>")
abstracts <- str_remove_all(abstracts, "</?[[:alnum:]- =\"]+>") # '</?[[:alnum:]- ="]+>'
abstracts <- str_replace_all(abstracts, "[[:space:]]+", " ")
```

``` r
titles <- str_extract(pub_char_list, "<ArticleTitle>[[:print:][:space:]]+</ArticleTitle>")
titles <- str_remove_all(titles, "</?[[:alnum:]- =\"]+>")
```

Finally, the dataset

``` r
database <- data.frame(
  PubMedId = ids,
  Title    = titles,
  Abstract = abstracts
)

| 34704071 | Sugar-Sweetened Beverage Fee: A Model to Address Health Disparities in Hawai’i.                                                                             | Sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption is associated with increased risk of obesity, diabetes, and other chronic diseases. SSB consumption is also a health equity issue, as rates of consumption and related chronic diseases vary by race, ethnicity, and income in Hawai’i. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for greater investment in public health and the well-being of communities experiencing health disparities because individuals with chronic diseases are more likely to develop complications from the virus. It has also created economic hardships for the people of Hawai’i, especially the state’s most vulnerable populations. Amid this health and economic crisis, an opportunity exists to implement an SSB fee in Hawai’i. An SSB fee would impose a fee on SSB distributors that would be passed on to consumers in the form of price increases that influence purchasing behavior. Jurisdictions with SSB taxes or fees have seen reductions in SSB purchases and consumption and have generated millions of dollars in revenues to support health initiatives and reduce socioeconomic disparities. Models predict that a $0.02 SSB fee in Hawai’i could generate $60.5 million and significantly reduce healthcare costs and chronic diseases. This commentary will present an SSB fee policy as a viable model for Hawai’i to reduce SSB consumption, lower chronic disease risks, and generate needed revenues to support health, reduce inequities, and rebuild the state’s economy. ©Copyright 2021 by University Health Partners of Hawai‘i (UHP Hawai‘i).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 34704070 | Health Literate Hawai’i: A Blueprint to Empower Health and Wellbeing.                                                                                       | Recent studies have identified high rates of chronic disease in Hawai’i’s adults and youth. As the state responds to the COVID-19 pandemic and looks beyond it, the prevention and management of chronic diseases are critical for community health and wellbeing. Low health literacy is more common in rural populations, Filipinos, and Pacific Islanders in Hawai’I, older adults, and many other groups with high rates of chronic disease. Promoting health literacy can reduce chronic disease burdens for individuals, families, and communities. Using the framework of the social-ecological model, which is important for visioning effective chronic disease management and prevention, this article provides a blueprint of layers of influence for building a health literate Hawai’I generally and around chronic disease specifically. The article will close with a call to action informed by the National Action Plan to Improve Health Literacy for stakeholders and providers to address health literacy in the state of Hawai’I in organizations, systems, and policy. These actions should address root causes of disease and help build more equitable health outcomes across the state now and in the future. ©Copyright 2021 by University Health Partners of Hawai‘i (UHP Hawai‘i).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 34704069 | He ’A’ali’i Kū Makani Mai Au: Developing a Cultural Framework for Advancing COVID-19 Related, Community-informed Health Policies.                           | The Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander community found itself on the front pages of national news when the COVID-19 pandemic struck the United States. By April 2020, the small, frequently overlooked community experienced the highest COVID-19 case rates in 5 states including Hawai’i. In response, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander networks across the US were mobilized to address the crisis. In Hawai’i, the Native Hawaiian Pacific Islander COVID-19 Response, Recovery, and Resilience Team was created. Framed by Indigenous Pacific based cultural values, protocols, and practices, the team consists of multiple committees that examine policy; testing, contract tracing, and isolation; communications; social supports and resources; and data and research. Inherent in this work are the shared core values of pono (righteousness, goodness), aloha (love, compassion), laulima (cooperation), and imua (moving forward with strength) as well as an ’ohana/aiga (family)-based, kuleana (responsibility)-centric approach that acknowledges, honors, and values ’ike kūpuna (ancestral knowledge). With the burden of not only COVID-19 disparities, but also chronic diseases and socioeconomic disparities that place Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander communities at increased risk for adverse impacts from COVID-19, an effective response is critical. This article, authored by members of the Team’s Policy Committee, discusses the development of a cultural framework that guides its advocacy efforts. The Policy Committee’s work presents a cultural framework that grounds and guides their efforts for effectively promoting a strong voice in governmental and agency policies which would ultimately contribute to a healthy and thriving Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander community. ©Copyright 2021 by University Health Partners of Hawai‘i (UHP Hawai‘i).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Utilizing their skills and the community’s trust, they are optimally positioned to reach marginalized and vulnerable populations hit hardest by COVID-19; community health workers educate, screen, and provide social service referrals to community members. ©Copyright 2021 by University Health Partners of Hawai‘i (UHP Hawai‘i).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 34704067 | Addressing Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander Data Deficiencies Through a Community-based Collaborative Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic.                | Early evidence of disproportionate COVID-19 infection and death rates in Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander communities in the continental US raised concerns for similar disparities in Hawai’i, where these communities make up 25% of the state’s population. Representatives from more than 40 different government, academic, institutional and community-based organizations partnered to form the Hawai’i Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander COVID-19 Response, Recovery, and Resilience Team. The team consists of 5 committees including the Data & Research Committee. This committee is tasked with examining issues regarding the acquisition, quality, public reporting, and utilization of race/ethnicity-related health data used to inform priorities and guide resource allocation. Problems addressed by this committee include: inconsistency across agencies in the use of race identifiers, defaulting to the Office of Management and Budget standards which aggregated Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders, and methods of data collection and reporting by the Department of Health. Outcomes include: 2 forms with race categories that reflect the population of Hawai’i; the reporting of disaggregated data by the Department of Health; and conversations with testing sites, laboratories, and health institutions urging a standardized form for race/ethnicity data collection. The collection and reporting of disaggregated race/ethnicity data is critical to guiding organizations in addressing underlying inequities in chronic disease and social determinants of health that can exacerbate the adverse effects of COVID-19. The Data and Research Committee’s network offers a community-based model for collaborative work that honors culture and ensures Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, and other minority populations are recognized and counted. ©Copyright 2021 by University Health Partners of Hawai‘i (UHP Hawai‘i).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 34704066 | Micronesians Building Healthier Communities During the COVID-19 Pandemic.                                                                                   | Micronesian communities in Hawai’i have a long history of mobilizing to address challenges they encounter as the most recent and fastest growing Pacific Islander immigrant population in the state. In particular, community leaders navigate a slew of obstacles specific to systemic racism and health care access. These hurdles have become exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, prompting a range of Micronesian-led responses to the health crisis including strategic adaptations to existing networks and roles to address essential public health functions. These community responses have filled many critical gaps left by the state’s delayed response to addressing the disparate impact of COVID-19 on Micronesian communities. This article highlights and encourages engagement with diverse models of collaboration and elevation of Micronesian leadership that has resulted in more productive cooperation with government leaders, agencies, and policymakers. This work offers insight into pathways forward toward healthier Micronesian families and communities. ©Copyright 2021 by University Health Partners of Hawai‘i (UHP Hawai‘i).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 34704065 | Exploring Challenges and Opportunities for Breastfeeding in Hawai’i During the COVID-19 Pandemic.                                                           | Increasing exclusive breastfeeding rates is an established public health strategy to reduce chronic disease and protect infants from illness. The role of breastfeeding in addressing health disparities takes on new significance as the COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately impacted some communities in Hawai’i, and those with chronic conditions face increased risk of hospitalization and death. However, there are myriad policy, systemic, and environmental barriers that make it difficult for parents to breastfeed, some of which have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. This editorial discusses the importance of breastfeeding in reducing chronic disease, reviews the status of breastfeeding in Hawai’i, explores the challenges parents face in breastfeeding their infants, especially in the time of COVID-19, and presents opportunities for improved access to lactation care to reduce health disparities. ©Copyright 2021 by University Health Partners of Hawai‘i (UHP Hawai‘i).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 34704064 | Much Needed Medicine: A Qualitative Study of Hawai’i Resident Views During COVID-19.                                                                        | The precarious financial status of the majority of Hawai’i residents coupled with the state’s heavy reliance on tourism suggests that residents are particularly vulnerable to increased economic hardship resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, which temporarily shut down the tourism industry and continues to erect barriers for resuming operations. Understanding how Hawai’i residents prioritize access to health care, food economics, care of ‘āina, and culturally informed community in light of the current and future economic situation can inform policy actions that will support public health. To that end, this paper analyzes: (1) Hawai’i residents’ views on health, specifically food security and healthcare, and their priorities for the future of these areas; (2) the differences between Native Hawaiian and non-Native Hawaiian views and priorities; and (3) the differences in views and priorities between families with higher and lower levels of economic stability. The authors close with policy recommendations that can be seen as medicine, or ways to heal Hawai’i, as the state shifts towards a more equitable and sustainable future. ©Copyright 2021 by University Health Partners of Hawai‘i (UHP Hawai‘i).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 34704063 | Prevalence of Psychological Distress in Hawai’i during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Exploring Disparities Using 11 Waves of Data from the Household Pulse Survey. | Utilizing 11 waves of data from the Household Pulse Survey collected between April and November 2020, this study examines disparities in psychological distress (defined as having symptoms of anxiety/depression) among adult residents of Hawai’i during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results showed that 36.4% of the respondents reported symptoms of distress. Younger age, female, and lower household income were associated with higher levels of psychological distress than older age, male, and higher household income. The prevalence ratios of distress for those aged 18-24, 25-34, 35-44 and females were 43.1%, 47.3%, 44.1%, and 39.3% respectively. Asians experienced lower prevalence compared to other racial/ethnic groups. Two practical implications are offered. First, the economic sequelae of COVID-19 impact psychological distress even when the community infection rate is stable. Second, disparities in psychosocial distress demonstrate that social and economic resources are needed by social groups such as young adults, females, and racial/ethnic minorities that have experienced the highest impact. Strategies need to be developed to mitigate the unavoidable local consequences of a pandemic. ©Copyright 2021 by University Health Partners of Hawai‘i (UHP Hawai‘i).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| 34687321 | The relevance of magnesium homeostasis in COVID-19.                                                                                                         | In less than one and a half year, the COVID-19 pandemic has nearly brought to a collapse our health care and economic systems. The scientific research community has concentrated all possible efforts to understand the pathogenesis of this complex disease, and several groups have recently emphasized recommendations for nutritional support in COVID-19 patients. In this scoping review, we aim at encouraging a deeper appreciation of magnesium in clinical nutrition, in view of the vital role of magnesium and the numerous links between the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2 infection and magnesium-dependent functions. By searching PubMed and Google Scholar from 1990 to date, we review existing evidence from experimental and clinical studies on the role of magnesium in chronic non-communicable diseases and infectious diseases, and we focus on recent reports of alterations of magnesium homeostasis in COVID-19 patients and their association with disease outcomes. Importantly, we conduct a census on ongoing clinical trials specifically dedicated to disclosing the role of magnesium in COVID-19. Despite many methodological limitations, existing data seem to corroborate an association between deranged magnesium homeostasis and COVID-19, and call for further and better studies to explore the prophylactic or therapeutic potential of magnesium supplementation. We propose to reconsider the relevance of magnesium, frequently overlooked in clinical practice. Therefore, magnesemia should be monitored and, in case of imbalanced magnesium homeostasis, an appropriate nutritional regimen or supplementation might contribute to protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection, reduce severity of COVID-19 symptoms and facilitate the recovery after the acute phase. © 2021.

| 34662333 | Modeling the epidemiological impact of the UNAIDS 2025 targets to end AIDS as a public health threat by 2030.                                               | UNAIDS has established new program targets for 2025 to achieve the goal of eliminating AIDS as a public health threat by 2030. This study reports on efforts to use mathematical models to estimate the impact of achieving those targets. We simulated the impact of achieving the targets at country level using the Goals model, a mathematical simulation model of HIV epidemic dynamics that includes the impact of prevention and treatment interventions. For 77 high-burden countries, we fit the model to surveillance and survey data for 1970 to 2020 and then projected the impact of achieving the targets for the period 2019 to 2030. Results from these 77 countries were extrapolated to produce estimates for 96 others. Goals model results were checked by comparing against projections done with the Optima HIV model and the AIDS Epidemic Model (AEM) for selected countries. We included estimates of the impact of societal enablers (access to justice and law reform, stigma and discrimination elimination, and gender equality) and the impact of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Results show that achieving the 2025 targets would reduce new annual infections by 83% (71% to 86% across regions) and AIDS-related deaths by 78% (67% to 81% across regions) by 2025 compared to 2010. Lack of progress on societal enablers could endanger these achievements and result in as many as 2.6 million (44%) cumulative additional new HIV infections and 440,000 (54%) more AIDS-related deaths between 2020 and 2030 compared to full achievement of all targets. COVID-19-related disruptions could increase new HIV infections and AIDS-related deaths by 10% in the next 2 years, but targets could still be achieved by 2025. Study limitations include the reliance on self-reports for most data on behaviors, the use of intervention effect sizes from published studies that may overstate intervention impacts outside of controlled study settings, and the use of proxy countries to estimate the impact in countries with fewer than 4,000 annual HIV infections. The new targets for 2025 build on the progress made since 2010 and represent ambitious short-term goals. Achieving these targets would bring us close to the goals of reducing new HIV infections and AIDS-related deaths by 90% between 2010 and 2030. By 2025, global new infections and AIDS deaths would drop to 4.4 and 3.9 per 100,000 population, and the number of people living with HIV (PLHIV) would be declining. There would be 32 million people on treatment, and they would need continuing support for their lifetime. Incidence for the total global population would be below 0.15% everywhere. The number of PLHIV would start declining by 2023. |

The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands has experienced modest community transmission, and Guam has had significant COVID-19 community transmission and morbidity. Although several of these United States Affiliated Pacific Island jurisdictions made difficult strategic choices to prevent the spread of COVID-19 which have been largely successful, the built environment and the population density in the urban areas of the Pacific remain inherently conducive to rapid COVID-19 transmission. Rapid transmission could result in devastating health and economic consequences in the absence of continued vigilance and long-term strategic measures. The unique COVID-19 vulnerability of islands in the Pacific can be modeled through examination of recent outbreaks onboard several United States Naval ships and other marine vessels. The environmental characteristics that pose challenges to infection control on an isolated naval ship are analogous to the environmental characteristics of these Pacific island communities. Considering a collection of case studies of COVID-19 transmission on ships and applying to Pacific Island environments, provides a heuristic, easily accessible epidemiologic framework to identify methods for interventions that are practical and reliable towards COVID-19 containment, prevention, and control. Using accessible evidence based public health policies, infection risk can be decreased with the objective of maintaining in-country health and social stability. These case studies have also been examined for their relevance to current discussions of health care infrastructure and policy in the Pacific Islands, especially that of vaccination and repatriation of citizens marooned in other countries. The need for aggressive preparation on the parts of territories and nations not yet heavily exposed to the virus is critical to avoid a rapid “burn-through” of disease across the islands, which would likely result in catastrophic consequences. ©Copyright 2021 by University Health Partners of Hawai‘i (UHP Hawai‘i).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Descriptive analysis of the data is presented to give a basic overview of the impact of COVID-19 in MC. A total of 883 participants in MC responded to the survey. Approximately one-third reported that they or family members experienced reduced work hours or lost their job because of COVID-19. In all questions related to paying for essential living needs, the percentage of participants who expected to have future problems was higher than the percentage who reported having current problems. Of those preparing for the fall 2020 school semester, expected challenges included lack of funds to purchase school supplies, lack of face coverings, and language barriers. Most participants in MC perceived the severity of COVID-19 to be moderate to very high, and there was a moderate level of knowledge about which groups are more at risk for contracting severe COVID-19. Less than half would know how to provide care for someone in their family with COVID-19. Several resource barriers for caring for a family member with COVID-19 were identified. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a more severe impact on Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander groups compared to others in the county. The results may provide a baseline for understanding the impact, needs, and threats to the health and social welfare of individuals and their families in MC. Local stakeholders can utilize this information to develop priorities, strategies, and programs to address the COVID-19 pandemic response in MC. ©Copyright 2021 by University Health Partners of Hawai‘i (UHP Hawai‘i).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 34661127 | A Report on the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Health and Social Welfare in the County of Kaua’i, Hawai’i.                                          | The Hawai’i Emergency Management Agency Community Care Outreach Unit (CCO) conducted a survey to gauge the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on the health and social welfare of individuals and their families across the state of Hawai’i. A mixed-methods framework was utilized for survey distribution. This article presents a descriptive analysis of the data to provide a basic overview of the impact of COVID-19 in Kaua’i County (KC), as assessed in August/September 2020. A total of 420 participants in KC responded to the statewide survey. Approximately one-third reported that they or their family members experienced reduced work hours or lost their job because of COVID-19. Many reported difficulties paying for many types of living essentials and expected these difficulties to increase in the near future. Prevalent challenges for the fall school semester included access to funds for school supplies and face-coverings. About one-third reported feeling nervous more than half the time or nearly every day in the past 2 weeks, and one-fourth reported feeling worried more than half the time or nearly every day in the past 2 weeks. The majority perceived the severity of COVID-19 to be moderate/very high and most had at least a moderate level of knowledge about risks for contracting severe COVID-19. Less than half said they would know how to provide care for someone in their family with COVID-19. Half of the respondents in KC reported maintaining social distancing usually/all of the time, the majority reported wearing a face-covering usually/always when needed. The results provide a baseline for understanding the impact, needs, and threats to the health and social welfare of households and their families in KC as a result of COVID-19. Local stakeholders can utilize this information for developing priorities, strategies, and programs to address the pandemic where needed and also to assess progress in areas of need. ©Copyright 2021 by University Health Partners of Hawai‘i (UHP Hawai‘i).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

A mixed-methods framework was utilized for survey distribution; 7927 respondents participated in the survey. This article presents key findings for the state’s Hawai’i County (HC). It presents a descriptive analysis of the data to provide a basic overview of the impact of COVID-19 in HC, as assessed in August-September 2020. A total of 936 participants from HC responded to the survey. Approximately one-third reported that they or their family members experienced reduced work hours, and one-fifth lost their jobs because of COVID-19. Many reported difficulties paying for many types of living essentials and expected these difficulties to increase in the near future. Challenges for the fall school semester included lack of access to funds for school supplies and face-coverings. The majority perceived the severity of COVID-19 to be moderate/very high and most had at least a moderate level of knowledge about risks for developing severe COVID-19. Approximately half reported maintaining social distancing usually/all of the time, and about two-thirds reported wearing a face-covering usually/always when needed. Other barriers for COVID disease prevention and response included a lack of space for quarantine/isolation of family members, not having enough cleaning supplies, low knowledge of how to care for a household member with COVID disease and not having someone available to care for them if they contracted the virus. The results provide a baseline for understanding the impact, needs, and threats to the health and social welfare of individuals and their families as a result of COVID-19 in HC. Local stakeholders can utilize this information when developing priorities, strategies, and programs to address the pandemic where needed. ©Copyright 2021 by University Health Partners of Hawai‘i (UHP Hawai‘i).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
